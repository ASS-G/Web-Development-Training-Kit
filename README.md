  ## Why Web Development?
  Web development broadly refers to the tasks associated with developing websites for hosting via intranet or internet. The web development process includes web design, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, among other tasks.
  
  ## Getting Started
  This might seem obvious, but I’m going to say it anyway:

At its core, web development is all about building websites.

A website may be a simple one page site, or it could be an incredibly complex web application.

If you can view it on the web in a browser, it has to do with web development.

## Part1 - We'll Start off with the basics
What web development is: explaining what’s actually happening when you load a website in your browser.
- <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: the foundation of every website.
- Helpful tools: using code editors and Git
- What’s front-end and back-end?
